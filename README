README
============
This is an easy to use and highly configurable image flow for PyQt. 
Features:

- Reflection
- Fading out of images to the sides
- Images are loaded and scaled in a separate thread,
  so the animation is always smooth.
- 5 different curves on which the images can flow.
- Detect image orientation from exif data
  (requires the Wand library from www.wand-py.org).
- Configurable: Disable all features that you don't want.
- Pure Python 3 and PyQt

To test the imageflow, download and extract the zip-file from
https://github.com/MartinAltmayer/ImageFlow/
and use
python3 imageflow/__init__.py  <folder with images>
Try also 
python3 imageflow/__init__.py  --help


To use the image flow in a PyQt-application, simply create an
imageflow.ImageFlowWidget
and add it to your layout. To configure the image flow have a look at the
available options at the top of imageflow/__init__.py and use setOption(s).
